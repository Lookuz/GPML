# Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning

This repository provides implementation for some of the algorithms and techniques explained in the textbook Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning, as well as example notebooks to experiment with these algorithms with. The GPML textbook consists of the following segments:

- **Regression**
- **Classification**
- **Covariance(Kernel) Functions**
- Model Selection
- Adapting Hyperparameters
- Approximation
- **Bayesian Optimization**(Not in GPML)

The bolded entries above indicates that a notebook is present for that topic.

For more detail, check the free GPML textbook: http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/


**Note**: The implementations in this repository may not in any way be optimized for production and deployment use, but rather for learning and experimentation use.
