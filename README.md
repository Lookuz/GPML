# Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning

This repository provides implementation for some of the algorithms and techniques explained in the textbook Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning, as well as example notebooks to experiment with these algorithms with. The GPML textbook consists of the following segments:

- Regression
- Classification
- Covariance(Kernel) Functions
- Model Selection
- Adapting Hyperparameters
- Approximation
